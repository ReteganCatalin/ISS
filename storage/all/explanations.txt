So the the structure of the cod is similar to the one from the first laboratory. 

I saved in a config file the conn string parent table name and child table name. 

I use the conn string to create an SqlConnection then i use that connection along with the table names from the config file 
to get data from the database into some sql data adapter. Then the content of them are put in the local storage, the data set. 

After that a relation is created and added to the data set using the primary key of the parent table and the foreign key from the
child table, this are also saved in the config file.

Finally we populate the gui elements using the data from the local storage. When the update button is clicked 
the local changes are propagated to the database.
