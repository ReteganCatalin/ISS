#### Fixes needed for tables

There is picture and the uml diagram generated by intelij
in the folder with the name 22_04_2020_database...
There the participant_list, ticketing, recommendation, role,
role_permission_id and role_user_list are not connected to the
database, meaning no foreign keys or any connected relations for them.
